# WIGOC Guide

The guide below covers both WIGOC's [gameplay](#gameplay) and [pieces](#pieces).

## Gameplay

### General

* Locations comprise the board and the graveyard
* Active pieces are played on the board
* Captured and dead pieces are sent to the graveyard

### Game states

1. Drafting phase: players are provided a fixed X amount of currency, which are used to buy up to 16 pieces *(similar to the buy phase in CS and Valorant)*
    * contested pieces are decided based on the highest bidder
    * equal bids are settled with a [diceroll](https://g.co/kgs/HuKNXmL)
2. Gameplay phase: played like normal chess with new pieces

## Pieces

* Some pieces have abilities
* Abilities are of three kinds
