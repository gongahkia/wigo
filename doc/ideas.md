## product

* make a simple svelte website 
* no AI, users take turns playing on the same device
* flip the board so easier to see? if its a website thing then make pieces recognisable and visible from both sides

## chess ideas

* make board asymeterical // weirdly shaped
    * not a conventional chessboard size is also ok
* players can draft their picks for specific chest pieces based on a dice roll // fixed amount of money like CS or Valorant
* mix of both card game and board game
* one-time effects and recharging effects with counters for both
* all captured pieces are sent to the graveyard
* whether i want to let pieces be replaced like a full deckbuilder (*consider properly*)
